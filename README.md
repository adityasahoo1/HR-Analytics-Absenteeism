# HR-Analytics-Absenteeism

Employee absenteeism poses a significant challenge for organizations, impacting productivity and overall performance. This project delves into HR analytics to analyze and derive insights from a dataset comprising raw employee information, including division, job title, age, length of service, and business unit. Leveraging Microsoft Excel, the data underwent meticulous cleaning, and various pivot tables and visualizations were created to illuminate patterns and trends.

The heart of this project is a dynamic dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of absenteeism. The dashboard includes key metrics such as total absent hours by gender, department-wise average absent hours, division-wise average length of service, and average absent hours by age group. The dynamic nature of the dashboard allows for real-time updates as the dataset evolves, ensuring the relevance and accuracy of the insights.

Through this analysis, the project aims to unearth correlations between employee demographics, job characteristics, and absenteeism, offering actionable insights for HR professionals and organizational decision-makers. The findings are presented in a visually engaging format, facilitating a clear understanding of the absenteeism landscape within the organization.

This project not only showcases the analytical capabilities of HR analytics but also underscores the practical utility of dynamic dashboards in synthesizing complex information into actionable intelligence. The insights gleaned from this analysis have the potential to inform targeted strategies for mitigating absenteeism, fostering a healthier and more productive work environment.
